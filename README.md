## Login/logout:

Create a login page where users can enter their username and password to log in.
Create a logout button or link on each page that logs the user out and redirects them to the login page.
Use sessions or cookies to keep track of whether a user is logged in or not.
 ## Signup:

Create a registration page where users can enter their name, desired username, password, and role (manager or user).
Store this information in a database or file.
After a user registers, redirect them to the login page.
## Task creation:

If the user is a manager, create a "Create Task" button or link on their dashboard.
Clicking this button should take the manager to a form where they can enter the task's title, description, end date, and assignee.
Store this information in a database or file.
## List of tasks:

If the user is a manager, display a list of all tasks on their dashboard.
If the user is a user, only display tasks that are assigned to them on their dashboard.
## Changing task status:

For each task, create a dropdown or button group that allows users to change the task's status (in progress, complete, incomplete).
Store the status information in the database or file.
